# About
* * *

I am a research associate at [NWEA Learning Sciences](https://www.nwea.org/research/) focusing on student growth, curricular opportunities, and equity in education. Prior to joining NWEA, I was a Policy and Research Intern at [J-PAL North America](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/na) providing technical assistance on randomized evaluations and supporting research dissemination activities. I have also previously led the Tisch Council for Philanthropic Leadership and served as a Tufts 1+4 Fellow working on tourism initiatives with the municipal economic development agency of Cuenca, Ecuador.

I am passionate about working with mission-driven and community-based organizations to leverage data for social good.
